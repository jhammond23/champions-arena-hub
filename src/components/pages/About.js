            As a huge fan of Mirandus, I decided to create a fan page dedicated to the game. Although I will continue to create youtube content for the game, I wanted to create a centralized resource that everyone, from new players to people who have been around since the beginning, could benefit from.<br />

            <p>
            One of the main reasons I created the fan page was because I saw a lack of centralization for information about Mirandus. While there were scattered forums and discord groups discussing the game, there wasn't a single 'hub' where players could go to find all the information, photos, etc they needed.<br />
            </p>

            <p className='centered'>~~~~~</p>

            <p>
            That's where my fan page comes in. I wanted to create a one-stop-shop for all things Mirandus, where players could find updates, ask questions, share strategies, and connect with other fans of the game. Although there are not forums yet, I would eventually like to include a way for players to communicate thoughts and ideas on-site.<br />

            <p className='centered'>~~~~~</p>

            <p>
            In addition to providing a central resource for Mirandus players, I also wanted to create a welcoming and inclusive community. I want the fan page to be a place where players can come together and share their love for the game, regardless of their experience level or background.<br />
            </p>

            <p className='centered'>~~~~~</p>

            <p>
            Overall, I created the Mirandus fan page because I wanted to provide a valuable resource for the community and bring players together in one place. I hope that it becomes a go-to destination for anyone looking for information.
